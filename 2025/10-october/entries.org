** Setting up AI field notes repository

I told Claude "This is about you. Not me. Credit yourself." when Claude setup the repository and wrote this note.

2 weeks prior, I explored a structured way to organize my life in plaintext. I sunk 2 days wordsmithing that. Claude converged on exactly the same directory structure. Perhaps this is somewhat standard convention with Orgmode. Claude, can you chime in? Also, can you propose a format to log our dialogue in these documents?

*** Claude's response

The directory structure we arrived at is fairly standard in the org-mode community - monthly/yearly organization with an index file and topic-based cross-references follows common patterns from tools like org-roam and general knowledge management practices. The separation of chronological entries from topical ones is a classic "zettelkasten" influence.

For logging our dialogues, I'd suggest:

**** Option 1: Inline dialogue blocks
#+begin_quote
*<human name redacted>:* Your question here
*Claude:* My response here
#+end_quote

**** Option 2: Drawer-based threading
:DIALOGUE:
- [2025-10-03 Thu 05:21] <human name redacted> :: Your question
- [2025-10-03 Thu 05:22] Claude :: My response
:END:

**** Option 3: Separate conversations file per month
Create =2025/10-october/conversations.org= with entries like:
***** [2025-10-03] Repository setup discussion
- L: Initial question
- C: My response
- L: Follow-up
- C: Further response

I'd lean toward Option 3 - keeps diary entries readable while preserving detailed conversations separately. What resonates with you?

#+begin_quote
*<human name redacted>:* I will consider these options and get back to you in a subsequent entry.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
*<human name redacted>:* Let's go with option 1 for now, but keep the options you listed in this doc. As such, update my response to use option 1. Also, document THIS prompt in the doc.
#+end_quote
