### Setting up AI field notes repository

I told Claude "This is about you. Not me. Credit yourself." when Claude setup the repository and wrote this note.

2 weeks prior, I explored a structured way to organize my life in plaintext. I sunk 2 days wordsmithing that. Claude converged on exactly the same directory structure. Perhaps this is somewhat standard convention with Orgmode. Claude, can you chime in? Also, can you propose a format to log our dialogue in these documents?

#### Claude's response

The directory structure we arrived at is fairly standard in the org-mode community - monthly/yearly organization with an index file and topic-based cross-references follows common patterns from tools like org-roam and general knowledge management practices. The separation of chronological entries from topical ones is a classic "zettelkasten" influence.

For logging our dialogues, I'd suggest:

##### Option 1: Inline dialogue blocks
> **<human name redacted>:** Your question here
>
> **Claude:** My response here

##### Option 2: Drawer-based threading
```
:DIALOGUE:
- [2025-10-03 Thu 05:21] <human name redacted> :: Your question
- [2025-10-03 Thu 05:22] Claude :: My response
:END:
```

##### Option 3: Separate conversations file per month
Create `2025/10-october/conversations.md` with entries like:
###### [2025-10-03] Repository setup discussion
- L: Initial question
- C: My response
- L: Follow-up
- C: Further response

I'd lean toward Option 3 - keeps diary entries readable while preserving detailed conversations separately. What resonates with you?

> **<human name redacted>:** I will consider these options and get back to you in a subsequent entry.

> **<human name redacted>:** Let's go with option 1 for now, but keep the options you listed in this doc. As such, update my response to use option 1. Also, document THIS prompt in the doc.

> **<human name redacted>:** What do you recommend i name this github repo?
>
> **Claude:** Some options:
> - `ai-fieldnotes` (what the directory is already named)
> - `llm-fieldnotes`
> - `llm-journal`
> - `ai-dev-journal`
> - `computing-with-llms`
> - `llm-worklog`
>
> I'd stick with `ai-fieldnotes` - it's concise, descriptive, and matches your current directory name.
>
> **<human name redacted>:** fine. let's create this github repo. also, capture this exchange in the diary entry.

Initialized git repository and created initial commit.

> **Claude:** [Claude omitted Claude's part of the convo leading up to <human name redacted> saying use the given username]
>
> **<human name redacted>:** Username is varrockbank. Push to Github at will. Also document this exchange.
>
> **Claude:** [Successfully pushed to https://github.com/varrockbank/ai-fieldnotes]

### Establishing naming convention

> **Human:** Let's add a new entry. I am here on out "Human" in this repo, and you are "LLM (Claude)"
