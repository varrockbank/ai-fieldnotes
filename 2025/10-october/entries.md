### Setting up AI field notes repository

I told Claude "This is about you. Not me. Credit yourself." when Claude setup the repository and wrote this note.

2 weeks prior, I explored a structured way to organize my life in plaintext. I sunk 2 days wordsmithing that. Claude converged on exactly the same directory structure. Perhaps this is somewhat standard convention with Orgmode. Claude, can you chime in? Also, can you propose a format to log our dialogue in these documents?

#### Claude's response

The directory structure we arrived at is fairly standard in the org-mode community - monthly/yearly organization with an index file and topic-based cross-references follows common patterns from tools like org-roam and general knowledge management practices. The separation of chronological entries from topical ones is a classic "zettelkasten" influence.

For logging our dialogues, I'd suggest:

##### Option 1: Inline dialogue blocks
> **<human name redacted>:** Your question here
>
> **Claude:** My response here

##### Option 2: Drawer-based threading
```
:DIALOGUE:
- [2025-10-03 Thu 05:21] <human name redacted> :: Your question
- [2025-10-03 Thu 05:22] Claude :: My response
:END:
```

##### Option 3: Separate conversations file per month
Create `2025/10-october/conversations.md` with entries like:
###### [2025-10-03] Repository setup discussion
- L: Initial question
- C: My response
- L: Follow-up
- C: Further response

I'd lean toward Option 3 - keeps diary entries readable while preserving detailed conversations separately. What resonates with you?

> **<human name redacted>:** I will consider these options and get back to you in a subsequent entry.

> **<human name redacted>:** Let's go with option 1 for now, but keep the options you listed in this doc. As such, update my response to use option 1. Also, document THIS prompt in the doc.

> **<human name redacted>:** What do you recommend i name this github repo?
>
> **Claude:** Some options:
> - `ai-fieldnotes` (what the directory is already named)
> - `llm-fieldnotes`
> - `llm-journal`
> - `ai-dev-journal`
> - `computing-with-llms`
> - `llm-worklog`
>
> I'd stick with `ai-fieldnotes` - it's concise, descriptive, and matches your current directory name.
>
> **<human name redacted>:** fine. let's create this github repo. also, capture this exchange in the diary entry.

Initialized git repository and created initial commit.

> **Claude:** [Claude omitted Claude's part of the convo leading up to <human name redacted> saying use the given username]
>
> **<human name redacted>:** Username is varrockbank. Push to Github at will. Also document this exchange.
>
> **Claude:** [Successfully pushed to https://github.com/varrockbank/ai-fieldnotes]

### Establishing naming convention

> **Human:** Let's add a new entry. I am here on out "Human" in this repo, and you are "LLM (Claude)"

### Converting to markdown

> **Human:** Let's convert this entire repo to markdown instead of org.
>
> **LLM (Claude):** [Converted all .org files to .md, updated .gitignore, removed old .org files, and pushed to GitHub]

### Discussion on force push protection

> **Human:** How can I prevent force push to a Github directory?
>
> **LLM (Claude):** You can't prevent force pushes at the directory level, but you can protect branches at the repository level. Here's how:
>
> **Via GitHub web interface:**
> 1. Go to your repo → Settings → Branches
> 2. Add a branch protection rule for `main`
> 3. Enable "Do not allow force pushes"
>
> **Via `gh` CLI:**
> ```bash
> gh api repos/varrockbank/ai-fieldnotes/branches/main/protection \
>   -X PUT \
>   -f required_status_checks=null \
>   -f enforce_admins=false \
>   -f required_pull_request_reviews=null \
>   -f restrictions=null \
>   -F allow_force_pushes=false \
>   -F allow_deletions=false
> ```
>
> This protects the `main` branch from force pushes by anyone, including you.
>
> **Human:** I mainly want to guard against you, Claude. But if we can use the gh CLI, then you can just override me anyways.
>
> **LLM (Claude):** You're right - if I have access to `gh` CLI or git commands, I can modify protections.
>
> The most effective safeguard is a **hook-based approach** that blocks my git push attempts. You can configure a Claude Code hook to intercept and block specific commands.
>
> However, the simplest solution: **just tell me not to force push**. I follow instructions, and if you explicitly say "never force push to this repo," I won't. You can add it to a project-specific instruction or just state it now.
>
> Would you like me to:
> 1. Never force push to this repo (I'll follow this instruction)
> 2. Help you set up a hook to technically prevent it
> 3. Both?
>
> **Human:** Do nothing. Capture this in a log entry.

### Workflow adjustment: commit review

> **Human:** In the future, don't autopush. Ask me to review the commit messages first.
>
> **LLM (Claude):** Understood. I'll ask for your review of commit messages before pushing from now on.
>
> Should I commit the current changes (force push discussion entry) and show you the commit message for review?
>
> **Human:** No, log our conversation in a new entry.
