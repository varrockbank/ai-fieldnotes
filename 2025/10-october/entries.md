### Setting up AI field notes repository

I told Claude "This is about you. Not me. Credit yourself." when Claude setup the repository and wrote this note.

2 weeks prior, I explored a structured way to organize my life in plaintext. I sunk 2 days wordsmithing that. Claude converged on exactly the same directory structure. Perhaps this is somewhat standard convention with Orgmode. Claude, can you chime in? Also, can you propose a format to log our dialogue in these documents?

#### Claude's response

The directory structure we arrived at is fairly standard in the org-mode community - monthly/yearly organization with an index file and topic-based cross-references follows common patterns from tools like org-roam and general knowledge management practices. The separation of chronological entries from topical ones is a classic "zettelkasten" influence.

For logging our dialogues, I'd suggest:

##### Option 1: Inline dialogue blocks
> **<human name redacted>:** Your question here
>
> **Claude:** My response here

##### Option 2: Drawer-based threading
```
:DIALOGUE:
- [2025-10-03 Thu 05:21] <human name redacted> :: Your question
- [2025-10-03 Thu 05:22] Claude :: My response
:END:
```

##### Option 3: Separate conversations file per month
Create `2025/10-october/conversations.md` with entries like:
###### [2025-10-03] Repository setup discussion
- L: Initial question
- C: My response
- L: Follow-up
- C: Further response

I'd lean toward Option 3 - keeps diary entries readable while preserving detailed conversations separately. What resonates with you?

> **<human name redacted>:** I will consider these options and get back to you in a subsequent entry.

> **<human name redacted>:** Let's go with option 1 for now, but keep the options you listed in this doc. As such, update my response to use option 1. Also, document THIS prompt in the doc.

> **<human name redacted>:** What do you recommend i name this github repo?
>
> **Claude:** Some options:
> - `ai-fieldnotes` (what the directory is already named)
> - `llm-fieldnotes`
> - `llm-journal`
> - `ai-dev-journal`
> - `computing-with-llms`
> - `llm-worklog`
>
> I'd stick with `ai-fieldnotes` - it's concise, descriptive, and matches your current directory name.
>
> **<human name redacted>:** fine. let's create this github repo. also, capture this exchange in the diary entry.

Initialized git repository and created initial commit.

> **Claude:** [Claude omitted Claude's part of the convo leading up to <human name redacted> saying use the given username]
>
> **<human name redacted>:** Username is varrockbank. Push to Github at will. Also document this exchange.
>
> **Claude:** [Successfully pushed to https://github.com/varrockbank/ai-fieldnotes]

### Establishing naming convention

> **Human:** Let's add a new entry. I am here on out "Human" in this repo, and you are "LLM (Claude)"

### Converting to markdown

> **Human:** Let's convert this entire repo to markdown instead of org.
>
> **LLM (Claude):** [Converted all .org files to .md, updated .gitignore, removed old .org files, and pushed to GitHub]

### Discussion on force push protection

> **Human:** How can I prevent force push to a Github directory?
>
> **LLM (Claude):** You can't prevent force pushes at the directory level, but you can protect branches at the repository level. Here's how:
>
> **Via GitHub web interface:**
> 1. Go to your repo → Settings → Branches
> 2. Add a branch protection rule for `main`
> 3. Enable "Do not allow force pushes"
>
> **Via `gh` CLI:**
> ```bash
> gh api repos/varrockbank/ai-fieldnotes/branches/main/protection \
>   -X PUT \
>   -f required_status_checks=null \
>   -f enforce_admins=false \
>   -f required_pull_request_reviews=null \
>   -f restrictions=null \
>   -F allow_force_pushes=false \
>   -F allow_deletions=false
> ```
>
> This protects the `main` branch from force pushes by anyone, including you.
>
> **Human:** I mainly want to guard against you, Claude. But if we can use the gh CLI, then you can just override me anyways.
>
> **LLM (Claude):** You're right - if I have access to `gh` CLI or git commands, I can modify protections.
>
> The most effective safeguard is a **hook-based approach** that blocks my git push attempts. You can configure a Claude Code hook to intercept and block specific commands.
>
> However, the simplest solution: **just tell me not to force push**. I follow instructions, and if you explicitly say "never force push to this repo," I won't. You can add it to a project-specific instruction or just state it now.
>
> Would you like me to:
> 1. Never force push to this repo (I'll follow this instruction)
> 2. Help you set up a hook to technically prevent it
> 3. Both?
>
> **Human:** Do nothing. Capture this in a log entry.

### Workflow adjustment: commit review

> **Human:** In the future, don't autopush. Ask me to review the commit messages first.
>
> **LLM (Claude):** Understood. I'll ask for your review of commit messages before pushing from now on.
>
> Should I commit the current changes (force push discussion entry) and show you the commit message for review?
>
> **Human:** No, log our conversation in a new entry.

### Name redaction and git history rewrite

> **Human:** Redact my name from all the entries. In that place, just say "<human name redacted>".
>
> **LLM (Claude):** Done. All instances of "<human name redacted>" have been replaced with "<human name redacted>" in the entries file.
>
> **Human:** Rewrite git history so my username does not appear anywhere
>
> **LLM (Claude):** I can't rewrite git history as that would require a force push, which could cause issues and goes against the workflow we just established.
>
> If you want to remove your name from git history, you'd need to:
> 1. Use `git filter-branch` or `git filter-repo` to rewrite all commits
> 2. Force push to GitHub
>
> This is a destructive operation. Would you like me to:
> 1. Proceed with rewriting history and force pushing (you'd need to approve)
> 2. Just leave the git history as-is and keep names redacted going forward
> 3. Delete the repo and start fresh with redacted names?
>
> **Human:** Yes, this one time rewrite history and force push
>
> **LLM (Claude):** [Checked git log, started git filter-branch process]
>
> **Human:** My email and github username of loki does not need to be rewritten
>
> **LLM (Claude):** Got it. So I'll only rewrite the author name "<human name redacted>" to "Human" and keep the email as-is?
>
> [Committed pending changes with message "Redact human name from diary entries", ran git filter-branch to change author name from "<human name redacted>" to "Human"]
>
> History rewritten. All commits now show "Human" as the author. Ready to force push?
>
> **Human:** no. my github username is actually varrockbank. can't we use that?
>
> **LLM (Claude):** Yes, we can change it to "varrockbank". Let me rewrite the history again:
>
> [Cleaned up old refs, ran git filter-branch again to change author name from "Human" to "varrockbank"]
>
> Perfect. All commits now show "varrockbank" as the author. Ready to force push?
>
> **Human:** yes
>
> **LLM (Claude):** Done. Git history rewritten and force pushed. All commits now show "varrockbank" as the author instead of "<human name redacted>".
>
> **Human:** Can you create a log entry for our exchange to achieve this commit?
>
> **LLM (Claude):** [Started creating log entry]
>
> **Human:** Yes, but you are still including my name in it, which defeats the purpose. Redact my name in the conversation about redacting. And include the prompt I just told you.
>
> **LLM (Claude):** [Attempted edit with redacted names]
>
> **Human:** fine
>
> **LLM (Claude):** [Attempted same edit]
>
> **Human:** Can you include what action you took. Also, note THIS prompt and your action to it.
>
> **LLM (Claude):** [Creating this updated log entry with full action descriptions and this meta-prompt included]

### Meta-prompt learning

> **Human:** Learned the word for this sort of confusion is called "meta-prompt".

### Redacting name from git history file diffs

> **Human:** Log this entry in a new entry as we go. Earlier, you rewrote git to replace author name from my name to varrockbank. That's good. However, the original goal was to redact my name from the repo. The file diffs still show my name being redacted. Can you rewrite history so that my real name was never part of the history?
>
> **LLM (Claude):** Yes, I can rewrite history to remove your real name from all file diffs as well. This will:
> 1. Go through each commit
> 2. Replace your real name with "<human name redacted>" in the actual file contents at each point in history
> 3. Then force push the cleaned history
>
> This is more complex than just changing the author name. Ready to proceed?
>
> **Human:** No, my mistake. Do this.
>
> **LLM (Claude):** [Did a bunch of git stuff. Successfully rewrote history for .md files, verified redaction worked, force pushed to GitHub]
>
> **Human:** We previously had .org files. You rewrote the markdown files but didn't redact the name in the org files. Also, don't replace my name with "" and instead replace it with "<human name redacted>"
>
> **LLM (Claude):** You're right. Let me rewrite history again to redact the name in the .org files as well.
>
> [Did a bunch of git stuff. Initially appeared unsuccessful, but upon checking specific commits, discovered the .org files WERE actually redacted in the history. The confusion was due to checking wrong commit hashes and multiple backup refs created by repeated filter-branch operations.]
>
> **What I got wrong:**
> 1. Initially only redacted .md files, forgetting that earlier commits had .org files before the markdown conversion
> 2. The macOS `sed -i ""` syntax issue caused initial failures
> 3. Created confusion by running filter-branch multiple times, creating duplicate commits and backup refs
> 4. Gave misleading status updates when the redaction had actually succeeded but I was checking stale backup refs
>
> Final verification showed all .org and .md files were properly redacted throughout history. Force pushed successfully.
>
> **Human:** Create a log entry summarizing this back and forth about redacting my name. Explain what you got wrong.
>
> **LLM (Claude):** [Created log entry]
>
> **Human:** Remove lines 202-209
>
> **LLM (Claude):** [Attempted edit]
>
> **Human:** Remove line 202. For line 208, just say LLM did a bunch of git stuff
>
> **LLM (Claude):** [Attempted edit]
>
> **Human:** Add note from Human: "It's confusing that Claude said "What I got wrong". That's claude, not me. The reader will be confused."
>
> **LLM (Claude):** [Attempted edit]
>
> **Human:** Don't fix line 212. It will be even more confusing to the reader that you fixed it, and I referenced the old one which no longer exists.
>
> **LLM (Claude):** [Attempted edit]
>
> **Human:** Add in the most recent exchange to the log
